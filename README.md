Snow-Flow revolutionizes ServiceNow development by bringing the power of AI orchestration directly to your platform. With 100+ MCP tools and intelligent multi-agent coordination, Snow-Flow transforms how developers and administrators work with ServiceNow.

## 🚀 Why Snow-Flow?

### **Accelerate Development by 10x**
Traditional ServiceNow development requires deep platform knowledge, manual coding, and countless hours of configuration. Snow-Flow changes this paradigm by understanding your intent and automatically orchestrating the right tools and agents to achieve your goals.

### **Learn While You Build**
Every interaction with Snow-Flow provides insights into ServiceNow best practices, platform capabilities, and optimal implementation patterns. It's like having a ServiceNow expert guiding you through every step.

### **Real Integration, Real Results**
Unlike mock tools or simulations, Snow-Flow connects directly to your ServiceNow instance through secure OAuth authentication. Every operation is real, every deployment is functional, and every result is production-ready.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### 🤖 **Intelligent Multi-Agent System**
- **25+ Specialized Agents**: From architects to testers, each agent brings specific expertise
- **Swarm Coordination**: Agents work together using hierarchical, mesh, or adaptive topologies
- **Shared Memory**: Persistent knowledge base ensures consistency across all operations
- **Neural Learning**: Pattern recognition improves suggestions and automation over time

### 🔧 **100+ ServiceNow MCP Tools**
- **Operations**: Incident, Request, Problem, and Change management with AI analysis
- **Development**: Create widgets, flows, scripts, and business rules with natural language
- **Integration**: REST/SOAP endpoints, data transformation, and external system connectivity
- **Analytics**: Real-time dashboards, KPIs, and predictive insights
- **Security**: Compliance rules, audit trails, and vulnerability scanning

### 🧠 **Natural Language Interface**
Simply describe what you want to achieve:
- "Create an incident management dashboard with SLA tracking"
- "Build an employee onboarding workflow with approval steps"
- "Analyze our incident resolution patterns from the last quarter"

Snow-Flow understands your intent and orchestrates the entire implementation.

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### **For Developers**
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Build complex solutions in minutes instead of days
- **Best Practices Built-In**: Every generated artifact follows ServiceNow standards
- **Continuous Learning**: Discover new platform capabilities through AI suggestions
- **Error Prevention**: Intelligent validation catches issues before deployment

### **For Administrators**
- **Process Optimization**: AI analyzes workflows and suggests improvements
- **Predictive Insights**: Anticipate issues before they impact users
- **Compliance Automation**: Ensure security and regulatory requirements are met
- **Knowledge Capture**: Document institutional knowledge in the graph database

### **For Organizations**
- **Reduced Time-to-Value**: Deploy solutions 80% faster
- **Lower Training Costs**: New team members become productive immediately
- **Consistent Quality**: AI ensures standardized, maintainable implementations
- **Innovation Enablement**: Focus on business logic, not technical complexity

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation
```bash
npm install -g snow-flow
```

### 2. Initialize Snow-Flow
```bash
snow-flow init
```
This creates:
- `.env` file for your credentials
- `.mcp.json` for Claude Code integration
- Project configuration files

### 3. Configure OAuth Credentials
Edit the generated `.env` file with your ServiceNow OAuth details:
```env
SNOW_INSTANCE=your-instance.service-now.com
SNOW_CLIENT_ID=your-oauth-client-id
SNOW_CLIENT_SECRET=your-oauth-client-secret
```

### 4. Authenticate
```bash
snow-flow auth login
```
This opens your browser for OAuth authentication.

### 5. Start Building!
```bash
snow-flow swarm "Create an incident management dashboard with real-time updates"
```

### 💡 Quick Examples
```bash
# Analyze your ServiceNow instance
snow-flow swarm "Give me a health check of my ServiceNow instance"

# Build a widget
snow-flow swarm "Create a widget showing open incidents by priority"

# Optimize performance
snow-flow swarm "Find and fix performance issues in my incident table"
```

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**OAuth Issues?**
- Ensure your OAuth client has the necessary scopes in ServiceNow
- Check that the redirect URI is set to `http://localhost:3000/callback`
- Try `snow-flow auth logout` then `snow-flow auth login` again

**MCP Connection Failed?**
- Run `snow-flow init --force` to regenerate configuration
- Restart Claude Code after configuration changes
- Check logs with `snow-flow logs`

## 📊 Real-World Impact

### **80% Faster Development**
AI orchestration eliminates repetitive tasks and automates complex workflows.

### **90% Error Reduction**
Intelligent validation and best practice enforcement prevent common mistakes.

### **100% Platform Coverage**
Every ServiceNow module and capability is accessible through natural language.

### **∞ Learning Potential**
Continuous pattern analysis reveals optimization opportunities you didn't know existed.

## 🛣️ Roadmap: Snow-Flow Pro (Coming Soon)

### **Co-Op Mode** 🤝
Perfect for environments where direct instance access isn't possible:
- **No OAuth Required**: Work entirely offline with your table schemas
- **Schema Import**: Provide your custom tables and field definitions
- **Smart Development**: Snow-Flow develops against your exact configuration
- **Export Ready**: Receive complete Update Sets or Import Sets
- **Full Compatibility**: Generated artifacts work perfectly in your instance

Example workflow:
```bash
# Import your instance schema
snow-flow coop import --tables incident,change_request,custom_table

# Develop without connection
snow-flow coop develop "Create approval workflow for custom_table"

# Export ready-to-import package
snow-flow coop export --format update-set
```

### **Bring Your Own LLM** 🧠
Choose your preferred AI backend:
- **OpenAI GPT**: For maximum capability
- **Anthropic Claude**: For nuanced understanding
- **Local Models**: For complete data privacy
- **Custom Fine-tuned**: For organization-specific patterns

### **Enterprise Features** 🏢
- **Multi-Instance Management**: Develop once, deploy everywhere
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared knowledge graphs and patterns
- **Audit & Compliance**: Full tracking of AI-generated changes
- **SLA Guarantees**: Priority support and uptime commitments

## 🌟 Why Snow-Flow Transforms ServiceNow Development
