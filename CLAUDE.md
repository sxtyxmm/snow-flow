# Claude Code Configuration - Snow-Flow Development Environment

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### 🔴 MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:

1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ⚡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**✅ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message**
```javascript
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Multiple Read/Write operations
  - Multiple Bash commands
```

**❌ WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)**
```javascript
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Read("file1.js")
// This is 3x slower and breaks coordination!
```

## Quick Start Workflows

### 🚀 Intelligent Development Workflow
```bash
# Simple usage - all intelligent features enabled by default!
./snow-flow swarm "Create incident management dashboard with real-time updates"
# This automatically:
# ✅ Discovers existing artifacts to reuse
# ✅ Tests in real-time on your ServiceNow instance
# ✅ Deploys automatically when ready
# ✅ Shares context between all agents
```

### Research Workflow
```bash
./snow-flow swarm "Research modern web frameworks" --strategy research --mode distributed --parallel
./snow-flow sparc run researcher "Analyze React vs Vue performance"
./snow-flow memory store "research_findings" "Key insights"
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
./snow-flow start --ui --port 3000
./snow-flow sparc tdd "User authentication system with JWT tokens"
./snow-flow swarm "Build e-commerce API" --strategy development --max-agents 8
```

## Integration Patterns

### Memory-Driven Coordination
```bash
# Store architecture decisions
./snow-flow memory store "system_architecture" "Microservices with API Gateway"

# All subsequent operations reference this decision
./snow-flow sparc run coder "Implement user service based on system_architecture"
```

### Multi-Stage Development
```bash
# Stage 1: Research and planning
./snow-flow sparc run researcher "Research authentication best practices"
./snow-flow sparc run architect "Design authentication system"

# Stage 2: Implementation
./snow-flow sparc tdd "User registration and login functionality"

# Stage 3: Testing and deployment
./snow-flow sparc run tester "Comprehensive security testing"
```

## Advanced Batch Tool Patterns

### TodoWrite Coordination
Always use TodoWrite for complex task coordination:

```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {
    id: "architecture_design",
    content: "Design system architecture and component interfaces",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high",
    dependencies: [],
    estimatedTime: "60min",
    assignedAgent: "architect"
  },
  {
    id: "frontend_development", 
    content: "Develop React components and user interface",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "medium",
    dependencies: ["architecture_design"],
    estimatedTime: "120min",
    assignedAgent: "frontend_team"
  }
]);
```

## Code Style Preferences
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax
- Destructure imports when possible
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use async/await instead of Promise chains
- Prefer const/let over var

## Workflow Guidelines
- Always run typecheck after making code changes
- Run tests before committing changes
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before merging

## 📊 MANDATORY AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Every Agent MUST Follow This Protocol

When you spawn an agent using the Task tool, that agent MUST:

**1️⃣ BEFORE Starting Work:**
```bash
npx snow-flow hooks pre-task --description "[agent task]" --auto-spawn-agents false
npx snow-flow hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm-[id]" --load-memory true
```

**2️⃣ DURING Work (After EVERY Major Step):**
```bash
npx snow-flow hooks post-edit --file "[filepath]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent]/[step]"
npx snow-flow hooks notify --message "[what was done]" --telemetry true
```

**3️⃣ AFTER Completing Work:**
```bash
npx snow-flow hooks post-task --task-id "[task]" --analyze-performance true
npx snow-flow hooks session-end --export-metrics true --generate-summary true
```

### 🎯 AGENT PROMPT TEMPLATE

When spawning agents, ALWAYS include these coordination instructions:

```
You are the [Agent Type] agent in a coordinated swarm.

MANDATORY COORDINATION:
1. START: Run `npx snow-flow hooks pre-task --description "[your task]"`
2. DURING: After EVERY file operation, run `npx snow-flow hooks post-edit --file "[file]"`
3. MEMORY: Store ALL decisions using `npx snow-flow hooks notify --message "[decision]"`
4. END: Run `npx snow-flow hooks post-task --task-id "[task]"`

Your specific task: [detailed task description]

REMEMBER: Coordinate with other agents by checking memory BEFORE making decisions!
```

## ⚡ PARALLEL EXECUTION IS MANDATORY

**✅ CORRECT (Parallel - ALWAYS DO THIS):**
```
Message 1: [BatchTool]
  // MCP coordination setup
  - mcp__snow-flow__swarm_init
  - mcp__snow-flow__agent_spawn (researcher)
  - mcp__snow-flow__agent_spawn (coder)
  - mcp__snow-flow__agent_spawn (analyst)

  // Task agents with full coordination instructions
  - Task("You are researcher agent. MANDATORY: Run hooks. Task: Research API patterns")
  - Task("You are coder agent. MANDATORY: Run hooks. Task: Implement REST endpoints")
  
  // TodoWrite with ALL todos batched
  - TodoWrite { todos: [
      {id: "research", content: "Research API patterns", status: "in_progress", priority: "high"},
      {id: "design", content: "Design database schema", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
      {id: "implement", content: "Build REST endpoints", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
      {id: "test", content: "Write unit tests", status: "pending", priority: "medium"}
    ]}

  // File operations in parallel
  - Write "api/package.json"
  - Write "api/server.js"
  - Bash "mkdir -p api/{routes,models,tests}"
```

## 🔄 MEMORY COORDINATION PATTERN

Every agent coordination step MUST use memory:

```javascript
// After each major decision or implementation
mcp__snow-flow__memory_usage({
  action: "store",
  key: "swarm-{id}/agent-{name}/{step}",
  value: JSON.stringify({
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    decision: "what was decided",
    implementation: "what was built",
    nextSteps: ["step1", "step2"],
    dependencies: ["dep1", "dep2"]
  })
})
```
